TASK:
We are given an undirected graph. A bridge is defined as an edge which,
when removed, makes the graph disconnected (or more precisely, increases
the number of connected components in the graph). The task is to find all
bridges in the given graph.

Follow Up: We have to do this in a given time complexity of O(N+M).

SOLUTION:
