SOLUTION:

a and b grams of cheese

okay so i guess i am the fox.

we need to make them equal as soon as possible by reducing them to 1/2, 1/3
and 1/5.

How to approach the solution...............................................
So if there exists a common divisor then there will exist some ans for the
problem.

Do prime factorization of a and b.
How about writing a recursive code that checks for all valid paths. Only if
we cant find any relation between which number to divide by what.

15= 3 x 5
20= 2 x 2 x 5
delete all the common terms and if the left part just contains 2, 3 or 5 then
there exists a solution with remaining no of elements in both of there
prime factorization.
