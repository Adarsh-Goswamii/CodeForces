SOLUTION:

(Sliding window)
So we just need to tell whether its possible or not.
The only tricking thing about this code is that we need to choose what
should be assigned to ? wisely or we will end up ruining the whole thing.

10??100 this be out sequence and we have to make this string 4 balanced

so out possibilities are that we can choose the pattern to be 1010100
or 1001100 both satisfies the criteria for the first window but as we slide
it we will face issues in 1010100, check the last sub string 0f len 4 0100
which is not satisfying the criteria.

So, how to deal with this problem
