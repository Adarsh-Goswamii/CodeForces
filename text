SOLUTION:

n inflorescence [1...n]
1 is situated at the bottom

1 apple per inflorescence

In a particular inflorescence there can be only one apple at a time
or all apples will rot if even || only one apple wont rot if odd.

So we have a tree and the apples are at all nodes and apples move from
leaf till root and at root they get collected.

We have the parent array.

So we need to find the chronology or the path in which they move towards 1
