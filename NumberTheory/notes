Let's call a rooted tree a spruce if its every non-leaf vertex
has at least 3 leaf children. You are given a rooted tree, check
whether it's a spruce.

so we need to check for every non leaf node how many children they
have and among them which one are leaf nodes.

Approach 1:
Just make a set of all the non leaf nodes.
